    "The challenge is to build and deliver a model which will predict the \"handle\", or the total amount wagered, on the matches in week 12 of the 2020 season (this is the week directly following that in the dataset).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "* wagering did not become available in all of the provinces at the same time\n",
    "* each team plays at most once per week\n",
    "* when wagering becomes available in a province, we have observed that new players are especially exited to play\n",
    "* for those of you who are seasoned bettors - all of these wagers are straight single-leg wagers for simplicity, don't worry about parlays etc...\n",
    "* users are not able to place a bet before they have registered\n",
    "* we would love to see some intermediate to advanced SQL used for feature engineering \n",
    "* we have pre-clustered the game times into several time slots (it might be useful to know how many other games are competing for attention)\n",
    "* it may be useful to think of a couple of ways to measure a team's popularity \n",
    "* it's up to you what type of model(s?) you use, but let us know why you made that decision\n",
    "* the goal is that this takes no longer than 4 hours\n",
    "* we love to see results, but we are most interested in understanding your thought process so please prioritize the writeup\n",
    "* describe limitations within the data, and let us know some features that you think might benefit the analysis (it's okay if you don't have specific betting or sports experience, just use what you know and take your best shot) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### *We understand that thorough treatment of a data science problem takes a lot of time, and we want to do our best to respect your time.  Keep in mind we are most interested in understanding your thought process, so if you start to run out of time, please focus on writing out the how's, what's and why's of what you would have liked to do.*"
